He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination.
