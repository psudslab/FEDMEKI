They can have a different shape, such as triangular, rectangular or even a spike. Burst noise in ECG can be caused by electromagnetic waves and electrical or mechanical interference. In contrast, baseline drift is the change in the baseline shape of the wave. It can be a flat line or a sloped line. Baseline drift can be caused by a loose electrode,",

This means that the ECG recording is noisy.\nIn ECG, the baseline is the zero point where the QRS complex is centered.\nThis point should be at the baseline, but sometimes the baseline is shifted upwards\nor downwards due to noise. To correct the drift, the baseline must be reset.\nI will go through the ECG to see if it is indeed the baseline drift.\nFirstly, I can see that there is a very high noise",

This can be seen in the baseline drift pattern that is seen at the beginning of the ECG, which represents the baseline shift seen in the absence of a P wave. The electrodes should be placed in the proper location and reconnected to ensure accurate results. Answer 2: No",

The ECG shows several positive deflections, some of which are rounded or have a small peak, while the others are pointed with a narrow base.
