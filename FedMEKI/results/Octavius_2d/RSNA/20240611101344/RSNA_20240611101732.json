However, wide QRS complexes can be seen on leads V1 and aVF at various points in the tracing.

        "answer": " To answer this question, let's first start by knowing what an ectopic beat is. An ectopic beat, also known as an extra beat, is a beat that occurs in addition to the normal heart beat. Ectopic beats may be caused by either an early beat, or a late beat. Ectopic beats may be classified as a premature beat, or an escape beat. Premature beats are abnormal heartbeats that occur too early in the cardiac cycle and are often caused",

        "answer": " An ectopic beat is a beat produced by the ectopic focus, which is an ectopic impulse generated and conducted ectopically to the ventricle through a different pathway other than the sinus impulse, or conducted slowly to the ventricle through the AV node, which causes delay in the electrical conduction of sinus impulse and generates a socal beat. So, to diagnose ectopic beats, it is required to have the impulse conducted to the ventricle",

        "answer": " The most common cause of ectopic beats is cardiac ischemia, especially when it is associated with a long QTc ( 0.4\u79d2).

If the impulse is stronger than the sinus impulse, it will cause depolarisation and result in a premature beat. Ectopic beats have a shorter PR and a shorter QT. They will also be a different shape depending on where the impulse was initiated. They can be recognised by a sudden change of rhythm and an abrupt change of the PR and QT. They are often found",

        "answer": " An ectopic beat is an extra beat which occurs outside of the normal cardiac conduction pathway. In this case, the ectopic beat is a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) occurring before the next sinus beat (arrow) in lead II, III and AVF. The rest of the rhythm is sinus rhythm. The QRS complex duration in the PVC is wider than in the sinus beats. The T wave in the PVC is inverted. PVCs are not uncommon",

Ectopic beats are early beats occurring when the impulse is formed in a site other than the sinus node, at a rate different from the sinus rate. Ectopic beats can be caused by factors such as ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmogenic conditions, drug use, and electrolyte imbalances. Ectopic beats do not generally cause serious problems, and most of them do not need to be treated. Ect",
