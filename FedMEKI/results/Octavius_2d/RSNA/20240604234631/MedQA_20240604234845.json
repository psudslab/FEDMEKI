Baseline drift is the movement of the baseline in a particular direction, usually in a downward direction. It is caused by physiological factors such as changes in body temperature, electrode placement, and muscle activity. Static noise is the noise that is present throughout the entire ECG and is caused by electrical interference from various sources such <XSFQ/> .",
